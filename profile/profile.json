  "summary": "As a recent graduate from Lakehead University, having completed my Masters in Computer Science in January 2023, I bring a positive and organized approach to managing multiple priorities, while also showing a zeal to take on additional responsibilities for reaching team goals. While studying at Lakehead, I have gained expertise in various areas such as performance Algorithm design, compilers and  operating systems, computational intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning, to name a few. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on a multifarious range of projects, related to  Database management systems, the Internet of Things, embedded systems, data modeling and visualization, data visualization and web development using languages like C, C++, Java, Python, MERN stack, and much more.Having previously worked as a Research and Development Engineer at MTEM in India, I have honed my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, always striving to contribute to the firm's growth. Currently, I am working at Jarvis to further improve my developer skills and work on challenging projects using new technologies such as Docker, Hadoop, Sprigboot, Maven, REST API, and RDBMS, among others. I believe that being consistent, taking responsibility for one?s actions, and being diligent in all that I do, are crucial traits that help me become a better version of myself every day."
