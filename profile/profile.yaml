# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words 
summary: As a recent graduate from Lakehead University, having completed my Masters in Computer Science in January 2023, I bring a positive and organized approach to managing multiple priorities, while also showing a zeal to take on additional responsibilities for reaching team goals. While studying at Lakehead, I have gained expertise in various areas such as performance Algorithm design, compilers and  operating systems, computational intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning, to name a few. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on a multifarious range of projects, related to  Database management systems, the Internet of Things, embedded systems, data modeling and visualization, data visualization and web development using languages like C, C++, Java, Python, MERN stack, and much more.Having previously worked as a Research and Development Engineer at MTEM in India, I have honed my technical skills and problem-solving abilities, always striving to contribute to the firm's growth. Currently, I am working at Jarvis to further improve my developer skills and work on challenging projects using new technologies such as Docker, Hadoop, Sprigboot, Maven, REST API, and RDBMS, among others. I believe that being consistent, taking responsibility for one?s actions, and being diligent in all that I do, are crucial traits that help me become a better version of myself every day.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: This system enables users to monitor the machine specifications and usage data of multiple Linux systems. The monitoring agent gathers information on the hardware of each machine using Bash scripts and stores it in a PostgreSQL database that is provisioned with Docker. Resource utilization data is collected automatically using Crontab and can be analyzed using SQL queries. The tool was tested on a virtual machine running the CentOS7 distribution of Linux on the Google Cloud Platform, and every script was meticulously checked to ensure that it met all the requirements.
